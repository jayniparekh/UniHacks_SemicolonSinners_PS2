📌 Problem Statement
In the world of online dating, users often suffer from "Profile Blindness." It is nearly impossible to view your own photos and bio objectively. While AI tools can check for technical image quality, they lack the emotional intelligence and nuance required to judge a "vibe" or determine if a profile feels authentic.

Our Solution: A peer-review platform that crowdsources honest, anonymous, and constructive feedback from real people. We move beyond "swiping" and turn the community into a collective dating consultant, helping users put their most authentic self forward.
